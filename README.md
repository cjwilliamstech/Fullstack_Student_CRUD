# Student Management Application 

## This is a Full Stack CRUD application. 

I used React-Bootstrap for the front end, for the backend I utilized Django and Django REST Framework architecture. Django REST Framework to handle model serialization for API end points. 

You can view the architecture below. 

I haven't developed any testing scripts for this app as of yet. 

Deploying this to AWS or Linode for a live preview.
